There are a few reasons why it was necessary to rethink this prior work:\n","\n","1. Tags will not be a component of the testing or training dataset.\n","\n","    * This does not mean that tags will not continue to be important. However, I have decided that the our objective -- use of citations to create edges in a social network -- does not inherently involve tagging.\n","\n","1. In lieu of tags, metadata is being included in a format that is as independent from its origin as possible.\n","\n","    * Names in particular do require this. In bibliographic entries, the formatting of names varies widely by style guide. If names are to be considered as semantic information instead of as raw text, they should be presented in a data structure that makes the different parts of a name explicit.\n","\n","1. Metrics used to evaluate models will be carefully chosen to make them as interpretable as possible for individuals who do not know any low-level details of how our models operate.\n","\n","    * Changes in this direction reduce the amount of text that is required alongside any reported metrics.\n","\n","There may be several parts of this notebook where you may cry out, \"I have seen all of this before, in another notebook! This is not DRY!\" I insist on justifying myself by noting that in writing this notebook I have a slightly different purpose in mind, and that I do not wish to be constrained by any links or dependencies on an implementation that I may not wish to keep."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iqBT1GGgy6X1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1614578647271,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":3537,"user":{"displayName":"Peter Donovan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmevrWa6lY-MoKL6lRCYdlS09IgSTYxUPNKCYZ=s64","userId":"01568505250649921698"}},"outputId":"3bff0e34-a48f-4825-ee89-730b7cdc969f"},"source":["!pip install pickle5\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import pickle5 as pickle\n","import random\n","import time\n","import os\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from gensim.utils import simple_preprocess\n","\n","from People.NameList import NameList\n","#from google.colab import drive\n","#drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","#%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/AWCA/Colab_notebooks/CitationTagging/Sp21/CitationParser/"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: pickle5 in ./env/lib/python3.8/site-packages (0.0.11)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"R3I_B8gFwTD8"},"source":["## Datasets\n","\n","### Note on dataset selection\n","\n","For the moment, I will be loading the OpenCitations dataset for initial tests. There are a couple of serious limitations to this dataset which we should be aware of:\n","* It has a replicability issue: Because the OpenCitations dataset is too large to support a SPARQL query that asks for the DOI of _every_ cited work for which we have a raw-text citation, I had to use a LIMIT clause. There are no promises about whether the sample I got was representative of the corpus, so this is a little unfortunate.\n","* It is probably dissimilar to our dataset in important ways. Specifically, many of the bibliographic entities documented in the particular portion of the dataset that I have downloaded are journal articles on biology and medicine -- a fact that may be reflected in the style guides that are used.\n","\n","For these reasons, OpenCitations is an additional tool, not a replacement for our other datasets. I am using it for the moment so that I can focus on developing a parser using a clean dataset, without having to worry about whether my results are valid or whether the dataset generation process has bugs.\n","\n","Another challenge is that the Zotero dataset does not have raw text citations that are reliably matched with the corresponding metadata. A _mostly_ successful attempt to tackle this issue is included in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OEFWVWgEzCiPA35Ma20svEY5OhPCuPwI), but it is a beast, and the output has imperfections of a severity that is difficult to quantify definitively.\n","\n","In any case, the OpenCitations dataset will be used for development. Long-term goals might be:\n","* To include a more representative (or complete) sample of the OpenCitations corpus, for replicability, and\n","* To include the Zotero dataset.\n","\n","### Fields in the Dataset\n","\n","The dataset has the following fields for the models to use for prediction:\n","* **raw**: The raw text citation, represented as a string.\n","\n","The dataset has the following fields for the models to predict:\n","* **author**: The name(s) of the authors of the work, represented as `NameList` objects.\n","* **year**: The publication year of the work, represented as an integer.\n","* **title**: The title of the work, represented as a string.\n","\n","These three fields are the ones that are likely candidates to be used to construct edges; the others are much more questionable. Each of them is commonly found -- for example, 98.8% of records in the Zotero database have a publication year, 99.6% have an author, and 99.7% have a title.\n","\n","Every row used in this dataset will have all three fields, i.e., the datasets will look like someone called `dropna` on them to eliminate null values in those columns. I acknowledge that this means that what is left may not be representative of the raw-text citations that may be out there in the wild; however, as mentioned in the above paragraph, those three fields are fairly commonplace.\n","\n","It is worth noting, however, that other fields are available in case we decide to incorporate them into our analysis later. They are less common and less reliable, so I would only include them as a very late micro-optimization to our model, if at all.\n","* pages: The pages in which the work appeared in the container (book, anthology, journal issue, etc.) in which it was published, represented as a string containing digits, a hyphen, and then more digits (or just digits, if the work appears on only one page)\n","* volume: The volume in which the work appears, represented as a string.\n","* source_title: The name of the journal or other entity responsible for the publication of the work.\n","* issue: The issue in which the work appeared.\n","\n","Matching surnames, matching titles, and matching years should be sufficient grounds for declaring a match. `simple_preprocess` from Gensim.utils with deacc=True should be enough to get reliable matches, if the fields can just be extracted correctly.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-xBDR6gfm1go","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":174},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1614579656812,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":540,"user":{"displayName":"Peter Donovan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmevrWa6lY-MoKL6lRCYdlS09IgSTYxUPNKCYZ=s64","userId":"01568505250649921698"}},"outputId":"5e246476-2ef1-4cf2-f90f-3c829fd0f92e"},"source":["with open('datasets/occ_45K.pickle', 'rb') as dbfile:\n","  occ_45K = pickle.load(dbfile)\n","occ = pd.DataFrame()\n","occ['raw']    = occ_45K.raw\n","occ['author'] = occ_45K.author\n","occ['year']   = occ_45K.year\n","occ['title']  = occ_45K.title\n","print('I wished to get metadata for {} DOIs downloaded from the OpenCitations\\n'\n","      'SPARQL endpoint, '.format(\n","    len(occ.index)\n","), end='')\n","occ = occ.dropna()\n","print('but only {} complete rows of metadata were received.'.format(\n","    len(occ.index)\n","))\n","occ.sample(2)"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["I wished to get metadata for 45756 DOIs downloaded from the OpenCitations\nSPARQL endpoint, but only 45280 complete rows of metadata were received.\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                     raw  \\\n","13035  Xu, B, Liu, H, Su, N, Kong, G, Bao, X, Li, J, ...   \n","22512  Pan, H, Liu, Y, Liu, B, Lu, Y, Xu, X, Qian, X,...   \n","\n","                                                  author  year  \\\n","13035  Xu, Beibei; Liu, Hui; Su, Naifang; Kong, Guila...  2013   \n","22512  Pan, Hongsheng; Liu, Yongqiang; Liu, Bing; Lu,...  2014   \n","\n","                                                   title  \n","13035  Association Between Winter Season And Risk Of ...  \n","22512  Lethal And Sublethal Effects Of Cycloxaprid, A...
