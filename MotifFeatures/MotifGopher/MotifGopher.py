        MotifGopher instance.
        TEXTS - The texts to be searched for motifs.
        THRESH - The minimum frequency of a motif for it to be
                remembered by the MotifGopher. Frequency is calculated
                on a per-text basis, meaning that two appearances in a
                single text do not count for anything more than just one
                appearance.
        MAX_CORR - The maximum allowable cosine similarity between two
                included motifs. Calculated with shifts, in much the
                same fashion as cross-correlation, with the vectors
                being binary sequences of match-or-no-match with the
                motif of interest.
        CONFIDENCE - The required confidence level for any statistics
                that affect decisions made by the MotifGopher.
        R - The probability that a subsequent character will be included
                in a candidate motif.
        SAVETO - The location where logs and pickled output should be
                saved.
